"ERROR: In the function extract_rating_from_text, the text should have contained a number, but it was: Based on her previous experience with using similar objects, Eileen would likely rate the usefulness of a digital pen for taking notes during research as follows: \nRating: Very useful. \nEileen has used digital pens before to take notes while conducting research and found them to be very helpful in organizing her thoughts and keeping track of important information. The ability to digitize her notes allows her to easily access and refer back to them later, which can save time and improve the overall quality of her work. Additionally, the convenience and portability of a digital pen make it an ideal tool for use on-the-go or in different locations where she may not have easy access to a computer or other recording devices."
"ERROR: In the function extract_rating_from_text, the text should have contained a number, but it was: Based on Eileen's previous use of technology for academic purposes, I can assume that she would find a tablet device such as the iPad Pro 2019 (model number A1475) to be highly useful for reading and taking notes for her research paper. The iPad Pro has a large screen display with high resolution, making it easy to read and annotate text. It also has various features such as split-screen multitasking, which allows users to view two apps side by side; and Apple Pencil support, which enables users to take digital notes and draw diagrams directly on the screen. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Eileen finding the iPad Pro 2019 helpful for her research paper as \"high\" or \"very useful\"."
